**How It works**
Norepted is a youtube video embedder, it
basically embeds a video, like how your
teacher embeds a video on Google Slides
for class.
The code simply takes the video id from the
url and attaches to youtube-nocookie.com,
the embeded youtube video link. That
link then goes into a html video element
and your video appears like magic!

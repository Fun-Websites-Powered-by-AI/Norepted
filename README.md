# Norepted
Youtube Video Embedder
Norepted is a youtube video embedder, it basically embeds a video, like how your teacher embeds a video on Google Slides for class. 
# Features
- Norepted will prevent video ads but not pop-up ads that will appear on the video. 
- Norepted will also unrestrict restricted videos by your school organizations.
- Norepted would appear in your history, but not anything youtube related (since the video is IN the site), so anyone who would look at your history wouldn't be sus about it (well unless they know what Norepted is)!
- If you want to save a video, you can press the "Copy" button and it will copy the link. Paste this link on another tab and bookmark it. Notice the link will take you to the embedded video that completely fills the whole screen.

# How you use it
1. Enter your youtube link in the orange text box. <br>
2. Next, Press the green "LAUNCH" button or press the "Enter" key on your keyboard. <br>
3. Now the video embeds down below, it may take a few seconds depending on how fast your computer is. <br>
4. After each video, a wall of 3x3 videos will appear. You can copy the links of these videos and paste it in the orange box to restart the cycle.
# How does it work
  Norepted embeds a video based on your youtube video link. Similarly to how your teacher embeds a video on Google Slides for class.
The code simply takes the video id from the inputed url and attaches it to youtube-nocookie.com, the embeded youtube video link. That link then goes into a html video element and your video appears just like that! <br>

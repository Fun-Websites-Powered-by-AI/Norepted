# How it works
  Norepted embeds a video based on your youtube video link. Similarly to how your teacher embeds a video on Google Slides for class.
The code simply takes the video id from the inputed url and attaches it to youtube-nocookie.com, the embeded youtube video link. That link then goes into a html video element and your video appears just like that! <br>

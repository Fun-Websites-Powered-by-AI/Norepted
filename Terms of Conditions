By using this website you agree to following terms:
1	If you somehow know him in real life, do not snitch on the creator. And also please don’t say “It’s his fault for making Norepted.” I cannot control your activities on my website.

2	Please do not report this website to a teacher or principal [You can still do it, of course, but why?]. You can share it with your friends, but please make it limited. If you didn’t figure it out already, Norepted stands for “not reported.” The whole reason why this website was made was so it would not be restricted.

3 No duplicating Norepted, this is my website that I personally made. I do not want any duplications, though, you can still take inspiration. 

Ok, you also don’t have to completely follow the fourth condition, but I recommend following this rule at least somewhat. 

4	Don’t use it too much, especially during school [if you are]. I recommend only using it in school for educational purposes. I repeat, educational purposes. And after school, you can do whatever you want, but please note to frequently touch grass and take a break.

5	Enjoy the website while it lasts. I know probably one day Norepted would be reported [how ironic], but please be thankful for this convenience and don’t get too attached.
